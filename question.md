# Interview Questions

1) IAI -> Position at Prediction Kalman:
    1. What is Gaussian in 3D?
    2. What happens when I rotate the covariance matrix -> what happens to the bias at each state?

2) Where House Drone - Startup:
    1. Code with attitude save
    2. Code in C++ that needs to say "don't print something" -> easy
    3. What happens if the drone doesn't start -> they use PX4
    4. Algorithm that finds the shortest path on some board -> don't remember the full question

3) Flying Production:
    1. How to find the variance from visual odometry
    2. What is feed forward and how to combine this with PID -> why this is good
    3. What Kalman filter to use for prediction of the attitude angle
    4. If I change the IMU, what is the procedure to change and if this changes the PID values of the previous IMU
    5. If one of my drone engines doesn't spin, what do I need to check -> timing at the IMU (the answer)
    6. What are the benefits and problems with the MAVROS node and the use of ROS
    7. How to make an environment to calibrate gate for robust Kalman filter?!??

4) Elbit - Flying Control Engineer:
    1. If I am at the top of a mountain and I see 2 planes, how to determine which is heavier
    2. To write a simple control loop with PID controller

5) Formic AI:
    1. Write a function in C++ or Python to do some simple PID
    2. Transfer pixel from square
    3. What type of prediction of the angular state do you have and how does the algorithm work
    4. What is a Kalman filter and what is it used for?
